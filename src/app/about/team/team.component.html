              <h4> Andes and Amazon Field School</h4>
              
              <p>The Andes and Amazon Field School (Iyarina) is leading the scaling of ISFS in the Ecuadorian Amazon. This organization provides decades of experience as a broker between international students and indigenous people. Investments for scaling within Ecuador are managed  by Iyarina, including reinvestments coming from student fees. Iyarina’s experience guarantees  the quality and scope of the education services provided.
                   </p>
              <p>The Andes and Amazon Field School (AAFS) is an LLC registered in Arizona closely tied to an Ecuadorian sister LLC, Iyarina Limitada.“The mission of AAFS is to provide quality in-country education on the Ecuadorian Amazon in a safe and comfortable setting.  Each summer we bring together a top group of academic and indigenous experts for 8 weeks of learning and research.  AAFS provides employment and training to indigenous people that is compatible with the preservation of their culture and environment. It also trains undergraduate and graduate students to work with these communities.</p>
              <p>Since 1999 it has provided Amazonian Quichua and Shuar language training to 156 graduate FLAS Fellows (Title VI Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships) from 38 universities.  Many of these alumni are now working at the intersection of Amazonian culture and environment partnering with indigenous leaders they met at the field school. Located in an Amazonian Quichua community, AAFS has a vital network of indigenous leaders as well as non-indigenous academics in Ecuador who will help us carry out the project. After 20 years of building interpersonal-intercultural relationships between indigenous and non-indigenous people, the AAFS is well positioned to commercialize the model beyond the Quechuan context.</p>

              <h4>Global Consortium for Sustainability Outcomes</h4>
              
              <p>The Global Consortium for Sustainability Outcomes (GCSO) is leading  the scaling of ISFS worldwide.</p>
              <p>GCSO focuses on co-developing and testing potential solutions to urgent sustainability problems. It is a global network operating under the umbrella of Arizona State University Foundation. Its members include 12 major universities, research institutes, and corporate sponsors committed to transform ideas into action through research, development and capacity building. These institutions have the research, development, innovation and capacity-building talent to develop timely, affordable and scalable solutions that could result in desirable sustainability outcomes. GCSO generates and tests a wide range of solutions including technologies, policies, economic incentives, social change and cultural practices. 
                   </p>   
              <p>In Ecuador, the GCSO ensures that potential students become aware of the advantages of the model, and that new investors and donors consider the model’s performance and its potential for scaling beyond the Waorani. GCSO is key to leverage the ISFS model within its network of universities, investors, donors, and the study-abroad industry.
